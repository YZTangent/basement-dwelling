1. Standardize 
  a. MQTT Broker
  b. MQTT Port
  c. TOPICS for all the Channels

2. For ANC need to standardize:
  a. Sample rate
  b. Chunk size (num of audio samples processed at a time)
  c. Filter Length
  d. Bit Depth (dtype i.e. int16)
  e. Step size (MU, LMS adaptation rate, how fast filter weights change)
  g. Number of audio channels per sample (Mono Audio 1 channel)
  h. endianness/byte order
  i. Normalization / Scaling

3. Figure out Latency samples. (Num of samlples ref audio is delayed to compensate network server latency)
  a. approx: round(latency * sample rate)
